For my undergraduate senior thesis, I set out to solve the following problem:
**Verilog and other HDLs lack the expressivity and modularity of modern software
programming languages, due to a lack of features such as a strong type system,
recursion, pattern-matching, polymorphism, higher-order functions, and more.**

Specifically, I aimed to answer the following two questions:

1. Can I design a programming language that combines the powerful features of
software programming languages with the ability to describe electronic circuits?

2. Can I develop a compiler that accepts a program in this language and produces
an optimized Verilog module?

Over the course of a year, I determined the answer to both of these questions to
be **yes**, and the result was a programming language called Gemini.

Along the way, I demonstrated with my prototype that novel type-theoretic
concepts could be translated into concrete implementation. These concepts
included a type system with multiple kinds, dependent types, multi-phase
compilation, and "time as a type".

An extended version of my thesis can be found

Further, one can also look at developer-oriented
[documentation](https://zealous-swanson-536aa0.netlify.app/#/) and the [source
code](https://github.com/adisrini/gemini-lang) for more detail.
