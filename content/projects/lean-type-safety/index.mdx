For my final project in [CS242](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs242/), I used
the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) theorem prover to prove type safety
for a small, toy language.

In order to prove type safety, I proved three distinct properties:

**Theorem** (Progress): For any expression <IM>e</IM>, either <IM>e</IM> is a value, or there exists <IM>e'</IM> such that <IM>e</IM> evaluates to <IM>e'</IM> in one step. Formally, <IM>\forall e \in \mathcal{E}. e \textbf{ val} \vee (\exists e' \in \mathcal{E}. e \mapsto e')</IM>.

**Theorem** (Totality): For any expression <IM>e</IM>, there exists <IM>e'</IM> such that <IM>e'</IM> is a value and <IM>e</IM> evaluates to <IM>e'</IM> in zero or more steps. Formally, <IM>\forall e \in \mathcal{E}. \exists e' \in \mathcal{E}. e' \textbf{ val} \wedge e \mapsto^* e'</IM>.

**Theorem** (Preservation): If <IM>e</IM> is a natural number in the initial type environment, and <IM>e</IM> evaluates to <IM>e'</IM> in one step, then <IM>e'</IM> is a natural number in the initial type environment. Formally, <IM>\forall e, e' \in \mathcal{E}. 0 \vdash e : \textbf{ nat} \wedge e \mapsto e' \rightarrow 0 \vdash e' : \textbf{ nat}</IM>.

Lean's type system is more advanced than that of any other language I have used.
It is based on a version of [dependent type
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type) known as the [calculus of
constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions)[^1],
with a countable hierarchy[^2] of non-cumulative universes and inductive types.
This powerful type system provides the necessary power and expressivity to
formalize proofs about complex systems within the language.

Although there are many ways to write proofs in Lean, I mostly used
[tactics](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/tactics.html). As
described in the documentation, tactics "support an incremental style of writing
proofs, in which users decompose a proof and work on goals one step at a time".

There's a special tactic called `sorry`, which automatically satisfies the
relevant goal in scope, though it also displays a warning at the enclosing
theorem or lemma, since the proof is technically incomplete. This led to a very
pleasant programming experience, since I was able to stub out the complicated
parts of the proof with `sorry`, work on the easier bits, and then revisit the
harder ones once I was confident that the proof structure was sound. In fact, we
often do this in programming. In OCaml, for example, you can stub out a function
as follows:

```ocaml
let fib (x : int) : int = raise_s [%message "Not implemented!"]
```

This will type-check[^3], letting you use `fib` in the rest of your program as
if it were implemented correctly.

## Footnotes
[^1]: This type theory is also the basis of other proof assistants, such as
[Coq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq). 

[^2]: The type theory utilizes a hierarchy of such universes in order to avoid
[Girard's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_U#Girard's_paradox), the
type-theoretical equivalent of [Russell's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox). 

[^3]: Interestingly, this exposes a deficiency of OCaml as it exists today, which
is that it doesn't support algebraic effects. If it did, the function signature
may encode the fact that it throws an exception (e.g. using some imaginary
syntax, `int -> int exn`), which is different from the desired signature.
