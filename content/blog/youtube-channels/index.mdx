I spend a good amount of time watching YouTube videos. Whenever I have some
spare time and want to watch something, I typically browse YouTube first, as
opposed to Netflix or other streaming services. The reason for this is
three-fold:

1. The videos I watch on YouTube tend to be more educational and engaging than
the average TV show or movie.
1. The videos I watch on YouTube tend to line up well with my preferred break
duration, which is roughly 10-20 minutes.
1. The videos I watch on YouTube tend to have faster production cycles than TV
shows, which means I can reliably enjoy new content often.

In this post, I'll talk about some of my favorite YouTube channels.

### The Best

I'll talk about five of the best channels (in my opinion, obviously) in some
detail.

<YoutubeRating
    link="https://www.youtube.com/c/numberphile"
    name="Numberphile"
    length={2.5}
    frequency={3}
    category="Math">
    <div>
        <p>This is one of my all-time favorite channels. It was started by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Haran">Brady Haran</a> in
        2011. In the beginning, each video focused on a particular number and
        its interesting properties. However, the channel later expanded its
        scope to cover many fields within math, including abstract algebra, number
        sequences, geometry, topology, and so much more.</p>
        <p>One of the things that makes these videos so enjoyable is the format
        they follow. A prototypical Numberphile video consists of an expert in
        some domain – typically an academician of some sort – teaching the
        audience about some concept within that domain. Further, the pedagogical
        devices employed are exceedingly simple: in most videos, the expert is
        armed solely with a large sheet of brown paper, a black sharpie, their
        voice, and their enthusiasm. Occasionally, they will have some props
        such as dice or coins. In more recent videos, Brady adds cartoon-ish
        animations to make the videos more engaging and entertaining.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most importantly, however, is that each video feels highly
        approachable, and assumes little or no prior knowledge about the
        material being taught. The videos feel fully self-contained, with
        optional links in the description to extra footage or resources for
        learning more.</p>
        <p>In addition to the YouTube channel, there's a Numberphile podcast
        which I really enjoy. In a typical episode, Brady interviews some
        mathematician about their life and their journey in pursuing math.</p>

    link="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile"
    name="Computerphile"
    length={3}
    frequency={2.5}
    category="Computer Science">
    <div>
        <p>Computerphile is the sister channel to Numberphile, focusing on
        computer science as opposed to math. Although the videos are produced by
        a different person, Sean Riley, they feel similar in spirit to
        Numberphile videos in their format and goals.</p>
        <p>The videos span many fields in computer science, such as security,
        networking, AI, type theory, functional programming, and more.</p>

<YoutubeRating
    link="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths"
    name="Stand-up Maths"
    length={3.5}
    frequency={2}
    category="Math">
    <div>
        <p>I first encountered <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Parker">Matt Parker</a>, the
        man behind the channel, in a Numberphile video in which he talked about
        the number <a href="https://youtu.be/mhJY74Bw8mw">3435</a> back in 2012.
        Matt has since appeared in many more Numberphile videos, and continues
        to do so today, though he also has a separate channel that I enjoy.</p>
        <p>As the name suggests, the channel focuses on math(s) while injecting
        tons of humor (mostly in the form of puns) into the content, which makes
        the videos highly enjoyable. He covers a broad range of interesting
        areas within math. My favorite class of videos are those in which he
        takes on the role of an mathematically-inclined investigator looking
        into some real-world phenomena in a quantitative way (for example, <a
        href="https://youtu.be/GVhFBujPlVo">here</a> and <a
        href="https://youtu.be/8Ko3TdPy0TU">here</a>).</p>
        <p>I've been a fan of Matt for a while, and I was pleased when my
        employer, Jane Street, became his YouTube channel's principal sponsor.
        Matt puts a lot of time and effort into his videos, and has also written
        a couple of books and performs talks.</p>

    link="https://www.youtube.com/c/TomScottGo"
    name="Tom Scott"
    length={2}
    frequency={3}
    category="Linguistics, History, and more">
    <div>
        <p>Like Matt Parker, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Scott_(presenter)">Tom Scott
        </a> appeared in <a href="https://youtu.be/-5wpm-gesOY">a famous
        Computerphile video about time zones</a> many years ago which is when I
        first encountered him.</p>
        <p>Tom is an eloquent and engaging speaker, who covers a wider variety
        of subjects than any of the channels I've mentioned above, including
        linguistics (in which he is formally educated), history, geography,
        computer science, and more.</p>
        <p>He's also conducted a few game shows of his own invention, including 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/_xS-BIcu4ew"> Lateral</a> (inspired by the
        great Only Connect on which Tom himself appeared), DISCONNECTED, and
        most recently <a href="https://youtu.be/FJSI7QTAt_o">Money</a>.</p>
        <p>There are many more series Tom has created which I haven't mentioned
        here. That's one of the things I like most about his content: they cover
        so much breadth and almost all of them are interesting to me.</p>

<YoutubeRating
    link="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown"
    name="3Blue1Brown"
    length={4}
    frequency={1.5}
    category="Math">
    <div>
        <p>This channel is run by Grant Sanderson, and focuses on teaching
        advanced (at least, relative to the content in other channels I've
        mentioned) mathematics while making heavy use of visualization as a
        pedagogical device. Grant uses a open-source, Python-based tool
        called <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim</a>, which he
        developed himself, in order to produce the animations in his videos.</p>
        <p>I find these videos to be extremely high quality. It is clear that a
        lot of time and effort goes into not only producing the animations in
        the video, but also in creating the script for the video such that the
        material is conveyed as best as possible to achieve Grant's educational
        goals.</p>
        <p>Further, while the topics tend to be more advanced than those in
        Numberphile, Grant still assumes little prior knowledge and builds
        context up throughout the video or series of videos. As such, these
        videos tend to be slightly longer.</p>
        <p>Grant has made some guest appearances on Numberphile as well,
        downgrading his visualizations to those that can be produced on the
        large brown sheet of paper.</p>

### The Rest

The following channels are great as well, though I tend to browse them less
frequently than the ones above.
